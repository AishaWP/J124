# Final Project J124: Analysis Process
1. Decide on a topic for Data Analysis, in this case I want to conduct a decade analysis of the City of Escondido's Budget 
2. Brainstorm questions I want to glean from the data, which will determine the data I will need to pull from the archives
* Where has most of the cities budget been allocated to in the past decade?
* What has seen an overall increase in funding over the past decade?
* What has seen an overall decrease in funding over the past decade?
* Were there any budget changes due to covid-19?
* What is the average amount of money the police get yearly?
3. For this data analysis, I needed to find the budget breakdown for the each year for the past 10 years. I headed to city website and they had the annual budgetary analysis for each year easily accesible.
